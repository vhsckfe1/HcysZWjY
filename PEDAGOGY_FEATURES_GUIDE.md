## 🛠️ Implementation Guide for Developers

### Basic Implementation
```python
from educhain import Educhain

# Initialize client
client = Educhain()

# Generate pedagogy-specific content
def generate_educational_content(topic, pedagogy_type, **kwargs):
    content = client.content_engine.generate_pedagogy_content(
        topic=topic,
        pedagogy=pedagogy_type,
        **kwargs
    )
    return content

# Example usage
bloom_content = generate_educational_content(
    topic="Machine Learning",
    pedagogy_type="blooms_taxonomy",
    grade_level="University"
)
```

### Advanced Implementation Patterns

#### 1. Multi-Pedagogy Course Design
```python
def create_comprehensive_course(topic, duration="12 weeks"):
    course = {}
    
    # Start with Bloom's taxonomy for structure
    course['curriculum'] = client.content_engine.generate_pedagogy_content(
        topic=topic,
        pedagogy="blooms_taxonomy"
    )
    
    # Add project-based learning for practical application
    course['capstone_project'] = client.content_engine.generate_pedagogy_content(
        topic=topic,
        pedagogy="project_based_learning",
        project_duration=duration
    )
    
    # Include peer learning for collaboration
    course['collaborative_activities'] = client.content_engine.generate_pedagogy_content(
        topic=topic,
        pedagogy="peer_learning"
    )
    
    return course
```

#### 2. Adaptive Learning Path
```python
def adaptive_pedagogy_selection(student_profile, topic):

    pedagogy_map = {
        'visual': 'project_based_learning',
        'analytical': 'blooms_taxonomy',
        'social': 'peer_learning',
        'hands_on': 'constructivist',
        'competitive': 'gamification'
    }
    
    selected_pedagogy = pedagogy_map.get(
        student_profile.get('learning_style'), 
        'blooms_taxonomy'
    )
    
    return client.content_engine.generate_pedagogy_content(
        topic=topic,
        pedagogy=selected_pedagogy,
        grade_level=student_profile.get('level')
    )
```

#### 3. Content Caching and Optimization
```python
import hashlib
import json

class PedagogyContentCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = {}
    
    def get_content(self, topic, pedagogy, **kwargs):
        # Create unique key for caching
        key_data = {
            'topic': topic,
            'pedagogy': pedagogy,
            **kwargs
        }
        cache_key = hashlib.md5(
            json.dumps(key_data, sort_keys=True).encode()
        ).hexdigest()
        
        if cache_key not in self.cache:
            self.cache[cache_key] = client.content_engine.generate_pedagogy_content(
                topic=topic,
                pedagogy=pedagogy,
                **kwargs
            )

    """
)
```

### 3. Iterative Refinement
```python
def refine_content(base_content, feedback):
    """Refine content based on user feedback."""
    return client.content_engine.generate_pedagogy_content(
        topic=base_content.topic,
        pedagogy=base_content.pedagogy,
        custom_instructions=f"""
        Improve the following content based on feedback: {feedback}
        
        Original focus: {base_content.description}
        Make the content more engaging and practical.
        """
    )
```
